# Welcome to My Machine Learning Projects Repository

Hello, everyone! This repository houses my dedicated Machine Learning projects, a compilation of my learnings and passion-driven work that I have undertaken in my spare time.

## What's Inside?

This repository includes projects inspired by the 'Hands-On Machine Learning' book, supplemented with my own personal projects. The collection of projects showcases my journey through various Machine Learning topics:

- **Logistic Regression**: See the application of logistic regression techniques to predict real-world scenarios.

## Project Origins

Several of these projects are rooted in the book 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow'. This resource guided me through an exploration of Machine Learning concepts. 

In addition to these, you will also find projects born out of my curiosity and passion for learning and applying machine learning techniques to solve interesting problems. 

## Purpose of These Projects

These projects are dual-purpose- first, they provide hands-on experience which helped deepen my understanding of Machine Learning concepts, improving my coding and analytical skills in the process.

Secondly, this repository serves as a platform to share my learnings with others interested in the Machine Learning field. Whether you're a seasoned data scientist, an aspiring student, or simply curious about Machine Learning, these projects can provide valuable insights.

Feel free to dive into the projects, provide feedback, and reach out for any queries, discussions or collaborations. Enjoy exploring, and happy learning!
